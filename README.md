# Quem sou eu na Tabela Periódica?

This is an interactive Periodic Table game inspired by the well-known "Who Am I?" game. Developed as a pedagogical tool by students of the Chemistry Licentiate program at IFCE Campus Aracati.

I, Matheus Monteiro do Vale, am a native of Aracati, Ceará, Brazil. I am a qualified IT technician from IFCE (Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Ceará), Aracati campus, and currently, I am pursuing my Licentiate degree in Chemistry at the same institution.

This project, an interactive periodic table game titled "Quem sou eu na Tabela Periódica?" (Who am I in the Periodic Table?), was a collaborative effort with clear educational objectives. Our main goal is to create a dynamic and engaging learning tool that fosters curiosity, encourages critical thinking, and facilitates the formulation of questions about chemical elements. We believe that learning through play is a powerful approach to understanding complex scientific concepts.

This initiative was developed with the invaluable support and contributions of my fellow students: Matheus Monteiro do Vale, Werton Vitor Santos Nascimento, and Brandon Igor Santos Mota. Our work was conducted under the expert guidance and supervision of Professor Otilia Mônica Alves Borges.
